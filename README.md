# Cable Car Design Project

Welcome to the Cable Car Design Project repository! This project uses AutoDesk Inventor to design a cable car that travels along a 1/8-inch diameter steel cable at a speed of 7 ft/s. This project is part of our school assignment and will be completed in groups of two.
The final version is determined by numbers – the higher the number, the newer the version.

## Project Overview

In this project, our goal is to design and build a cable car system that:
- Travels along a 1/8-inch (0.125 in) steel cable.
- Moves at a constant speed of 7 ft/s.
- Balances properly on the cable, ensuring that the center of gravity and the centroidal axis are correctly aligned.
- Incorporates a gear train mechanism that includes meshing gears, ball bearings for reduced friction, and other necessary components (some parts can be 3D printed from GCode files).

The project will be carried out over approximately 4 weeks, with roughly 3 hours of design work allocated per week. In the final stage, the designs will be 3D printed, assembled, and tested to produce a functional prototype.

## Project Goals

- **Speed:** Achieve a cable car speed of 7 ft/s.
- **Balance:** Ensure the cable car maintains balance on a 1/8-inch diameter steel cable.
- **Gear Train:** Design and assemble a gear mechanism that meshes together smoothly, using ball bearings to reduce friction.
- **3D Printing:** Produce essential custom parts via 3D printing (uploading GCode files to the designated folder).
- **Travel Distance:** Allow the cable car to move 30 cm in both directions during testing.

## Design Process (S.P.I.C.E.)

We will follow the S.P.I.C.E. model for our design process:

1. **S - Situation**  
   - Understand the project requirements and constraints.
   - Identify key parameters such as cable diameter, cable car speed, and balance considerations.

2. **P - Problem Definition**  
   - Define the design challenges.
   - Establish initial specifications for gear ratios, center of gravity, and material properties.

3. **I - Ideation**  
   - Brainstorm multiple design ideas and sketch initial concepts.
   - Compare options and select the most feasible approach.

4. **C - Create**  
   - Develop detailed designs using AutoDesk Inventor.
   - Prepare files for 3D printing and begin assembling prototypes.

5. **E - Evaluate**  
   - Test the prototype on the cable.
   - Identify improvements and iterate on the design.
   - Finalize the design report based on testing and feedback.
